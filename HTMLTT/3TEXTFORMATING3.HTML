          Respected sir/madam
          
          With due Respect, I beg to say that I am a student of class 10th in your school. I am not feeling well today and also have some weakness. Hence I request you to please grant me two days leave.
          
          I hope you will consider my application. I will definitely try to remain present after 2 days.
          
          Thanking you.
          
          Yours obediently
          Name : Thapa Technical
